## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

The site was created by using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I wanted to put together a simple site without much overhead. The picture carousel was a Bootstrap component I hadn't yet used, so learning about it while implementing it for the first time was exciting.
