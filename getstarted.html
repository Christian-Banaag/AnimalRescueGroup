                <h2 class="mx-auto">Volunteer</h2>
                <p>
                    Exercise animals — We have some wonderful volunteers who regularly come by to walk the dogs, but there are so many times and days when there is a great need for additional walkers.  It’s both fun for the dog and you and great exercise for both of you!  Volunteers must be 16 years to volunteer on their own or be accompanied by an adult over the age of 18.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Foster care — Sometimes we’re full and cannot take another animal, but we’re faced with urgent needs to shelter an animal(s).  If you can spare an emergency few days, weeks, or months to help relieve the stress on our shelter and comfort an animal(s), we could use the help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pet and play with the animals — The easiest, most rewarding and fun thing you can do is come to the shelter to pet and play with the animals. Your visit and individual attention helps the animals stay comfortable around people and aides in their adoption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Community involvement — We need volunteers to represent the Animal Rescue Group at community events like School Programs, Community Festivals and Fairs, Parades, Service Group Meetings, Nursing Home and Assisted Living Visits, and more. If you like animals and people, this is a great opportunity for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professional services — Are you a plumber, carpenter, or electrician who can lend a hand and save us a repair bill?  Let us know if you are willing to work “in-kind” or offer your services at a reduced rate to our organization.
